**Consistent and transparent representation of specific material requirements of standards in JSON schema**

Welcome to the **VDA 231-301 JSON Schema Repository** the official home for the JSON schema standard for the digital exchange of material test results. This repository provides specifications and examples for implementing standards using the JSON Schema format. Its purpose is to ensure a consistent, transparent, and maintainable structure for representing standard requirements across different use cases.

This repository is maintained as part of the VDA initiative to enable an open, collaborative standard that supports various industry needs.
Developed jointly by the German Association of the Automotive Industry (www.vda.de), as well as the Institute for Engineering Design and Industrial Design (IKTD) at the University of Stuttgart (www.iktd.uni-stuttgart.de) and many contributors from the automotive industry.

## Sub-Schemas

Below you find general information to Subschema Workflow Repository. Additionally it describes the lifecycle of our subschemas from conception to official publication.


**Phase 1: Draft and Discussion (GitHub Repository)**
Each subschema begins its lifecycle as an independent repository on GitHub. These repositories serve as publicly accessible working drafts, inviting discussion and further development. In this phase, the focus is on collaboration and community feedback. Subschemas at this stage are not yet officially versioned. GitHub Issues and Discussions can be used for communication and gathering feedback. 


**Phase 2: Official Publication (Schema Repository)**
Once a subschema is deemed reviewed and ready for publication by the VDA-Product Group (PG), it transitions to the official publication phase. This includes official versioning of the subschema. Subsequently, the subschema is published in our central schema repository, which is accessible via a dedicated HTTPS page. Only subschemas in this repository are considered officially released and versioned.

**Currently, the following sub-schemas are officially released:**

EN 10204

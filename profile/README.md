# VDA 231-301 JSON Schema

Welcome to the **VDA 231-301 JSON Schema Repository**, the official home for the JSON schema standard for the digital exchange of material test results. This repository is maintained as part of the VDA initiative to enable an open, collaborative standard that supports various industry needs.
Developed jointly by the German Association of the Automotive Industry (www.vda.de), as well as the Institute for Engineering Design and Industrial Design (IKTD) at the University of Stuttgart (www.iktd.uni-stuttgart.de) and many contributors from the automotive industry.

**DISCLAIMER**: We are constantly working to improve the VDA 231-301. If there are any differences between JSON schemas on GitHub and the published document by the VDA, the PDF on the VDA website is valid. 
The current version of the official VDA 231-301 document can be found in the VDA Webshop ([German](https://webshop.vda.de/VDA/de/vda-231-301-022025) / [English](https://webshop.vda.de/VDA/en/vda-231-301-022025)).
